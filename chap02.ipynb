    "MATLAB® file c1p8.mat contains the data described in exercise 8 ofchapter 1. Use the spike-triggered average (calculated in that exercise) to construct a linear kernel and use it in equation 2.1 to provide a model of the response of the H1 neuron. Choose $r_0$ so that the average firing rate predicted by the model in response to the stimulus used for the data matches the actual average firing rate. Use a Poisson generator with the computed rate to generate a synthetic spike train from this linear estimate of the firing rate in response to the stimulus `stim`. Plot examples of the actual and synthetic spike trains. How are they similar and how do they differ? Plot the autocorrelation function of the actual and the synthetic spike trains over the range 0 to 100 ms. Why is there a dip at a lag of 2 ms in the autocorrelation of the actual spike train? Is there a dip for the synthetic train too? Plot the interspike interval histogram for both spike trains. Why is there a dip below 6 ms in the histogram for the actual spike train? What are the coefficients of variation for the two spike trains and why might they differ? (Based on a problem from Sebastian Seung).\n",
