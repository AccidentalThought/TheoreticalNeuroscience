# Theoretical Neuroscience

This is a repository for solutions for the exercises in the book
[Theoretical Neuroscience]
by P. Dayan and L.F. Abbott. 

Used data for and list of problems are available at official [website][Exercises].

Implementing of solutions is done in python *.py files, discussion and mathematical derivation are written in *.ipynb files (because of the math support).

## ToDo
* Problem c2p2 gives weird result
* Problem c2p6 wrong mathematical result


## Notes
* Would be nice to track units with the variables
* Add theoretical results in plots?
* Aim of the solutions is purely educational, therefore some parts are slower
    for the sake of understandability over the optimization
* There is an interesting phenomenon with Fano factors. For small bins it is always very close to 1 for Poisson process, although for bigger bins it usually tends away from one, even for longer durations. Is this reasonable or is there problem in implementation? 
* Presentation of the solution is changing quite a bit, when there is time I will try to unify it, in the mean time I am sorry for the mess

## Questions
1) What holds synapses together? Why are they stuck close together?
