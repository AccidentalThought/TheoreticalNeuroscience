# Theoretical Neuroscience

This is a repository for solutions for the exercises in the book
[Theoretical Neuroscience]
by P. Dayan and L.F. Abbott. 

Used data for and list of problems are available at official [website][Exercises].


## Notes
* Would be nice to track units with the variables
* Add theoretical results in plots?
* Aim of the solutions is purely educational, therefore some parts are slower
    for the sake of understandability over the optimization

### Chapter 1
* Notes on [Fano factor], [Poisson process]
* Fano factor is just a property of a spike times histogram
* Exercise 5: There is no paradox, the probability of this happening is given by
the number of states complying the condition divided by the total number of
possible states. 
* Exercise 6: signal processing question - see appendix A of chapter 1, direct Fourier transform leads to Peridogram - problematic for noise-like signal analysis

## Questions
1) What holds synapses together? Why are they stuck close together?

## TODO
* discussion on the result in exercise ch1p10
* discussion of the results in exercise ch1p9 move here?
