# Theoretical Neuroscience

This is a repository for solutions for the exercises in the book
[Theoretical Neuroscience]
by P. Dayan and L.F. Abbott. 

Used data for and list of problems are available at official [website][Exercises].

Implementing of solutions is done in python *.py files, discussion and mathematical derivation are written in *.ipynb files (because of the math support).

## Notes
* Would be nice to track units with the variables
* Add theoretical results in plots?
* Aim of the solutions is purely educational, therefore some parts are slower
    for the sake of understandability over the optimization


## Questions
1) What holds synapses together? Why are they stuck close together?
